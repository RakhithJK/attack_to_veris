Guiding Principles
1) The group decided that the linkage between VERIS and ATT&CK should be bi-directional.
2) Both VERIS and ATT&CK have a node/leaf model so focus should be on tree-to-tree structure with many-to-many relationships.
3) Team should concentrate on creating a mapping first to avoid ambiguity when dealing with mapping, schema, etc. simultaneously.
